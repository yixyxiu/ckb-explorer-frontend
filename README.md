REACT_APP_CHAIN_TYPE = 'testnet'                 # Set chain type (mainnet or testnet)

REACT_APP_MAINNET_URL = 'http://localhost:3000'  # MAINNET_URL is for deploying testnet, please ignore for development

REACT_APP_TESTNET_NAME = 'testnet'               # TESTNET_NAME will be displayed on explorer header and it also determines the subpath of the testnet
```

### Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-explorer-frontend.git
cd ckb-explorer-frontend
yarn install   # install dependency libraries
```

### Running locally
